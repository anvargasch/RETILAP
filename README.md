# RETILAP
This repository contains an Excel tool with macros designed to perform financial analysis and calculate the maintenance factor for public lighting projects, following Colombian regulations (RETILAP and CREG). The tool enables the evaluation of different lighting design alternatives by incorporating initial investment costs, operating expenses, energy consumption, and asset replacement costs over their life cycle. It facilitates the calculation of key financial indicators such as the Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) and Net Present Value (NPV), helping to select the most cost-effective lighting solution for public projects.
